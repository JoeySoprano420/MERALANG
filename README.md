## 🔣 Capsule Anatomy

```mera
capsule <name>:
    [meta + permissions + optimize toggle]
    [code block]
end
```

### Example:

```mera
capsule filter_image:
  optimize
  loop x from 1 to width - 1:
    loop y from 1 to height - 1:
      val blurred = blur_pixel(x, y)
      image_out[x][y] = blurred
  end
end
```

---

## 🧩 Shorthand Assembly Notation (SAN)

| **SAN Op**         | **Expands To**                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ADD_VAR a, b`     | `mov eax, [a]` → `add eax, [b]`           |
| `DIV_CONST a, c`   | `mov eax, [a]` → `mov ecx, c` → `div ecx` |
| `MOV_MEM dst, src` | `mov [dst], [src]`                        |

---

## 🔁 Loop & Control Flow

```mera
loop i from 0 to 10:
    say "i = {i}"
end

when i > 5:
    say "over halfway"
end
```

---

**"Merged syntax cheat sheet"**, which outlines the capabilities and philosophy behind **MeraLang v1.0**, a symbolic and performance-oriented programming language:

---

## 🧠 Summary: MeraLang v1.0 Cheat Sheet

**MeraLang** merges symbolic introspection with hardware-level optimization, creating a language ecosystem that is both **safe** and **high-performance**. It introduces a hybrid syntax combining **DG Tracing** (symbolic execution) and **DLMT Mapping** (direct assembly control), supported by a capsule-based execution model.

### 🔧 Core Features
- **DG Tracing**: Base-12 symbolic numeric system for introspective debugging.
- **DLMT Mapping**: Direct translation from high-level syntax to x86/x64 MASM assembly.
- **Capsule Execution Model**: Self-contained units with metadata, sandboxing, and rewind/replay APIs.
- **Visual Capsule Debugger**: Live opcode tracing and memory inspection.
- **Split/Toggled JIT**: Selective optimization of performance hotspots.
- **SAN (Shorthand Assembly Notation)**: Readable low-level syntax for direct control.
- **Cross-Platform Targets**: WASM, FPGA, x86/ARM, OpenCL GPU.

### 🧩 Developer Experience
- Multi-paradigm support: procedural, functional, declarative.
- Plugin hooks for IDE integration and AI modeling.
- Strong static typing and symbolic permission maps.
- Exception handling with symbolic checkpoints and rewind logic.

### 🚀 Strategic Benefits
- Safer systems programming via sandboxing and opcode verification.
- Transparent debugging for critical domains (aerospace, medical, finance).
- Performance without sacrificing readability.
- Educational tooling for teaching compiler theory and systems programming.
- Adaptive runtime for AI and emergent systems.

Certainly. Here’s a clear, structured breakdown of DGs, SAN, and DLMT — the three central concepts powering MeraLang’s hybrid execution engine:

⸻

🧠 DGs — Dodecagram IR (Intermediate Representation)

Stands for:
Dodecagram (12-sided symbol) → Represents a base-12 symbolic tracing model used as the introspective layer of MeraLang.

🔍 What It Is:

A symbolic execution layer that maps every action in your code to a traceable, reversible node, often in a base-12 format. DGs function like a memory-inspectable thought map of your program.

🧠 Features:
	•	Symbolic Tracing: Captures what the code means, not just what it does
	•	Checkpointing & Replay: DGs store execution states for deterministic debugging
	•	DG Nodes include:
	•	VAL_INIT – variable declarations
	•	FLOW_LOOP – loop structures
	•	TRACE_DERIVE – symbolic arithmetic like derive sum from sum by px
	•	DEBUG_WHEN – conditional state-based triggers
	•	REWIND_STATE – rollback triggers
	•	Base-12 Numerics: Reflects cyclic symbolic execution (instead of binary 0/1 logic)

🔁 Example:

derive sum from sum by px

🔄 becomes:

TRACE_DERIVE("sum", "sum", "px")

🧠 Used for introspective debugging, symbolic rollback, and program visualization.

⸻

🛠️ SAN — Shorthand Assembly Notation

Stands for:
Shorthand Assembly Notation

🧾 What It Is:

A readable pseudo-assembly syntax that maps high-level .mera constructs to low-level instructions without requiring direct use of raw NASM/MASM syntax.

🧱 Benefits:
	•	Friendly for systems programmers
	•	Readable enough for education
	•	Easily convertible to NASM, LLVM IR, or bytecode

🔧 SAN Instruction Types:

SAN Opcode	Meaning	x86 Equivalent
ADD_VAR x, y	x += y	mov eax, [x]; add eax, [y]
DIV_CONST x, c	x = x / c	mov eax, [x]; mov ecx, c; div ecx
MOV_MEM dst, s	dst = s (direct memory move)	mov [dst], [s]

🧠 Example:

val avg = sum / 9

➡️

DIV_CONST sum, 9
MOV_MEM avg, eax

🔌 Used for bridging between symbolic MeraLang code and real-world assembly.

⸻

⚙️ DLMT — Direct-Link Mapping Table

Stands for:
Direct-Link Mapping Table

📊 What It Is:

A performance mapping system that directly links high-level MeraLang constructs to platform-specific, optimized assembly sequences.

Think of DLMT as the assembly turbocharger of MeraLang.

🔧 Purpose:
	•	Maximize performance in numerical and I/O-heavy operations
	•	Allow hotspot toggling via optimize keyword
	•	Fully supports:
	•	SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)
	•	AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)
	•	FMA (Fused Multiply Add)

🔂 Example Mapping:

MeraLang	DLMT Mapping	x86 Equivalent
val x = 5	MOV_CONST x, 5	mov dword [x], 5
derive sum from a by b	ADD_VAR a, b	mov eax, [a]; add eax, [b]


⸻

🔄 Interplay Between the Three

Layer	Purpose	Tools
DG IR	Symbolic introspection + rewind engine	trace, rewind, inspect
SAN	Human-readable assembly	emit_nasm, visual_debug
DLMT	Raw performance mapping to CPU/GPU	optimize, emit_asm, JIT


⸻

🧩 Summary Table

Component	Stands For	Main Use	Analogy
DG	Dodecagram IR	Symbolic tracing & debugging	Abstract syntax tree + time machine
SAN	Shorthand Assembly Notation	Human-friendly low-level ops	Assembly with comments
DLMT	Direct-Link Mapping Table	Optimized real-world machine code	Compiled turbo mode


⸻

## 🔍 Expansion: Why MeraLang Matters

### 1. **Symbolic Fidelity Meets Hardware Precision**
MeraLang’s fusion of symbolic logic and direct assembly control is rare. Most languages sacrifice one for the other. Here, **DG IR** enables introspective debugging, while **DLMT** ensures raw performance. This duality is ideal for domains requiring both **traceability** and **speed**, such as scientific computing and embedded systems.

### 2. **Capsule Architecture as a Paradigm Shift**
Capsules encapsulate execution logic, metadata, and introspection tools. This modularity allows for:
- **Secure execution** (sandboxing, permission maps)
- **Deterministic debugging** (rewind/replay APIs)
- **Cross-domain deployment** (WASM, FPGA, native binaries)

It’s a step toward **self-contained, introspective software agents**—a concept with implications for AI, simulation, and autonomous systems.

### 3. **Educational and Research Utility**
The visual debugger, symbolic tracing, and macro system make MeraLang a powerful teaching tool. It demystifies low-level programming while preserving high-level expressiveness. This could revolutionize how compiler design and systems programming are taught.

### 4. **Adaptive Execution and AI Integration**
Runtime toggles, symbolic state awareness, and plugin hooks pave the way for **adaptive software**—programs that can introspect, modify themselves, and respond to changing conditions. This is foundational for **emergent systems** and **AI agents** that evolve over time.
