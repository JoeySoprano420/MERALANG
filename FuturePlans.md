🚀 MeraLang Roadmap: v0.1 to v1.0
🔹 v0.1 – Foundation Release
Goal: Establish symbolic execution and capsule architecture.

✅ Capsule-based execution model (.capsule files)

✅ DG tracing with base-12 numerics

✅ Macro system for reusable symbolic logic

✅ Opcode verifier and symbolic permission maps

✅ Inline NASM support with Hex VM backend

✅ Visual REPL with live opcode tracing

✅ Basic introspection: inspect, rewind, say, trace

🔹 v0.2 – Performance Layer Integration
Goal: Introduce DLMT-style mappings and hardware acceleration.

✅ DLMT (Direct-Link-Mapping-Table) for opcode-to-assembly mapping

✅ Shorthand Assembly Notation (SAN) for readable low-level code

✅ SIMD, AVX, and FMA support for numerical workloads

✅ optimize flag to disable introspection for hotspots

✅ GPU kernel execution via OpenCL bridge

🔹 v0.3 – Runtime Adaptability & Debugging
Goal: Enhance capsule introspection and error recovery.

✅ Capsule rewind/replay API with symbolic checkpoints

✅ try/catch with symbolic error handling

✅ Capsule health metrics: entropy, memory, execution trace

✅ Runtime state toggles (when state == "debug")

✅ Visual capsule debugger with memory inspector

🔹 v0.4 – Cross-Platform & Interoperability
Goal: Expand deployment targets and system integration.

✅ WASM output with symbolic trace support

✅ FPGA-deployable ISA variant

✅ LLVM IR bridge for FFI and native API calls

✅ .capsule → .asm → .hex → .bin pipeline

✅ Plugin system for macros, opcode injectors, and decorators

🔹 v0.5 – Language Maturity & IDE Integration
Goal: Finalize syntax, tooling, and extensibility.

✅ Universal grammar (ANTLR-ready)

✅ Visual IDE with REPL, debugger, and capsule explorer

✅ Hot-reloadable modules and symbolic FFI maps

✅ Capsule versioning and backward compatibility

✅ Documentation generator and symbolic trace visualizer
